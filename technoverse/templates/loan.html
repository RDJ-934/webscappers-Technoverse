            question: "What is the punishment for not paying loan?",
            answer: "In JavaScript, we can access the elements of an array by using their index positions. We can use the square bracket notation and specify the index number within the brackets to retrieve the desired element.

But just like the first loan, you will have to meet the eligibility requirements of the lender to get approval for the loan.
